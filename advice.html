		<h2><em>"Worth Every Cent(R)"</em></h2>
		</center>
	
		<ol>
			<li>Do not bring a laptop to class (or an iPod, or a cell phone (except on silent (not vibrate, silent))). This is unless, or course, for some reason, you are required to have it.</li>
			<li>Sit in the front row.  This way you will not be distracted by people on Facebook with their iPods.</li>
			<li>Take notes in a composition notebook with a pen or pencil.  One notebook per class, labeled in Sharpie.</li>
			<li>Buy textbooks used online.  International edition if possible.  Ask the professor if the previous edition of the text is OK.</li>
			<li>No music when studying.  Working, yes, studying, no.</li>
			<li>Do not read in bed.  If you read in bed, set an alarm because you will fall asleep.</li>
			<li>Do not underestimate the power of a power nap.  40 minuets is the sweet spot.</li>
			<li>Read "Sleep Warrior Hacks."  <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/50070632/sleepwarrior-sleep-hacks">http://www.scribd.com/doc/50070632/sleepwarrior-sleep-hacks</a></li>
			<li>Run. PT.  Every day do something.</li>
			<li>Eat plenty.  You feel better with fuel.</li>
			<li>Drink only water, juice, milk, and coffee.</li>
			<li>Use caffeine to your advantage when possible.</li>
			<li>Waking up early to study or finish a project never works.</li>
			<li>Have some way to unwind every day (XKCD, music, student newspaper).</li>
			<li>Being stressed never helps, so don't.</li>
			<li>Deadlines sneak up on you.</li>
			<li>You will not fail if the professor knows your name.</li>
			<li>Most professors are more than happy to explain things to you if you stop by their office.</li>
			<li>To shine shoes:
				<ol>
					<li> Clean off dirt with a damp cloth.</li>
					<li> Apply a thin coat of polish with a damp rag (old undershirt).  Use small circles.</li>
					<li> Let dry.</li>
					<li> Buff with another dry rag (old undershirt #2).</li>
					<li> Buff with camel hair brush. Across the toe, up and down the sides.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>If you review for 10 minuets a day, you will retain more than studying for hours the night before.</li>
			<li>Never work harder than you have to to earn an 'A.'</li>
			<li>Call your mom/dad/brother.  They love you and are willing to listen to you vent.</li>
			<li>It is easier to keep up than to catch up.</li>
			<li>Keep as little in your workspace as possible. No posters, bobbles, or trinkets.</li>
			<li>Your roommates love you if you have headphones and not speakers.</li>
			<li>Sleep is a tempting mistress, but she is for the weak.</li>
			<li>It is halfway over after noon on Wednesday.</li>
			<li>Collect free stuff. Every free shirt is 
another day to put off doing laundry.</li>
			<li>Study groups don't work.</li>
			<li>Stuck on a concept? Google and Wikipedia can probably explain it to you.</li>
			<li>There is no shame in asking for help.</li>
			<li>You can usually either:
				<ul>
					<li> Pay really good attention to the lecture and get a lot from it.</li>
					<li> Take really good notes.</li>
				</ul>
				Find out which is more important for each class.
			</li>
			<li>Get a calendar and mark every exam and due date and review it daily.</li>
			<li>Make a physical checklist of things to get done and mark of tasks as you finish them.</li>
			<li>Take showers.</li>
			<li>After working for a long time on a problem, many solutions can be reached by taking a break from it.</li>
			<li>Never write and proofread on the same day.</li>
